## Presentation

Hello everyone. my name is wwh. I'm from communication university of china. Thanks for giving me the chance to introduce my work.

now. here is the title , Scary but Fun: A Preliminary Experiment to Explore the Factors that Affect the Experience of Horror Games. 

firstly, we are going to talk about why we'd like to choose horror games to research. there are 5 reasons. the first one is that horror games can bring rich emotional experience easily. not only the fear ,but also the nerve and excitement. so the unique game types attract players. in other words, horror game is very popular among players, which is the second reason. next , the horror game market is a “blue ocean” in China  and less research. the last one is that I'm interested in horror games.

In the early stages of the research. we played lots of Commercial horror games. such as Resident Evil Series , Silent Hill Series  and so on. And then, we extracted some methods which can improve the feelings of fear. However the commercial games are more complex. because they include rich gameplay and gripping stories. So we decide to develop a custom horror game which contains the five events. 

1. Event 1: fear of oppression
2. Event 2: fear of weird 
3. Event 3: security of bright and peace 
4. Event 4: fear of light off
5. Event 5: fear of jump scare 

Every event is the special method mentioned above. like..1,2,4,5. but event 3 is different because it will be ease the emotion for comparing others.

In the end , We also have an ultimate goal to explore three research questions:

- Whether gender affects the rating
- Whether previous experience affects the rating
- Whether the level of horror affects the rating of the game

We conduct the experiment on 21 participants, 8 males and 13 females, They all have varying degrees of gaming experience. They  will answer user surveys for recording , after finish the game experience. we set the survey with 7(seven) questions. the first one is rating the total game. the second one is rating the level of horror about the game. the rest of the questions is rating the level of horror about every events.

As shown from Table , the overall rating given by players is concentrated between 2 and 4 points, and the variance is relatively low, indicating that the fluctuation degree of the score is relatively low. As a security event without fear, *Event 3* had the smallest mean among the 5 events (*M* = 2.43), which was consistent with our expectation. Finally, we find that the mean of horror rating for *Event 1* to *Event 5* is (*M1~5* = 2.964) very close to the mean of the overall horror given by players (*M* = 3.0).

And then , we use ANOVA to analyze game experience data. the result shows that 

Sense of horror is **not affected** by gender differences

Rating of the game is **not affected** by gender differences

well ,and ,the other result is previous experience is **negatively correlated** with the overall horror. that means the less experience players have in horror games, the more sensitive they are to horror.

the last result is that these external horror elements have **weak influence** on the overall rating of the game. we found that the horror elements that we designed can improve the level of horror feeling in the game. But horror is not the total of the game, even if it is a horror game. we reckon that Gameplay and plot is the core of game. some horror,  violence and VFX are just the decoration .Without the soul , the game is not fun.

by the way, after the experiment was done, we talked to the players. there is a participant says a  detail.  when she enter the safe- room , she feels more fear. because overall the game has more horror, the sense of fear is not strong. but  suddenly the player found a room with soft light on . the feeling of fear become more stronger.

That's all my report. Thanks for watching.
